## Specfication

The goal of the CLi is to empower developers with tooling and power tooling, like IDE extensions, to call the cli.

Ideally our CLI would be an installable binary and not require a user to have node or go installed on their machine.


## Top Commands

* authenticate
* call and see instances (like kube get pods)
* instantiate a folder that creates a zesty.json by asking for instance zuid
* pull existing project with a folder that has a zesty.json
* push existing folder that has a zesty.json
